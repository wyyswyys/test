All dialogues in the mod are secondary settings. There may be problems such as character collapse. Please refer to the Gensokyo in your mind.\nIf you are not sure how to recruit each character, there is a button in the steam workshop details page or the character task decision to view all character acquisition routes.\nThere are two strong military and industrial organizations added by the MOD. You can choose to turn them on or off in the decision interface, and the characteristics of the Yuedu Technology Military and Industrial Organization §Rcan only be improved§! by holding the Yuedu Vientiane Exhibition.\n§RPlease do not change the military and industrial organization researched by Yuedu Technology at will§!, which may cause the Yuedu debuff to be unable to be eliminated.\n§RNote that if a random purge of generals is about to occur, you can choose the second option in the recruitment event to postpone recruitment, otherwise the character may become invalid.§!"

At that time, being able to read was not an ordinary thing. The origin of Gensokyo in the early days was not so much for immediate reading as it was for passing on to future generations. I find it difficult to understand the text of that time now, so it is not very meaningful as a document.\nAfterwards, Al and Ami were reincarnated, and I was lucky to be born as the ninth generation. After reincarnation, most of the past memories were lost, but the ability of Qiuwenchi, which was possessed by my ancestor Ah Li, was inherited. Of course, I, Ah Qiu, also have this ability, which is very useful when compiling books.\nAs Ah Yi, and then Ah Li's reincarnation, I can finally understand this. But the memory of Gensokyo in the past is not clear. If you want to know the history of the past, you have to talk to Like ordinary people, I learned about it by looking through the information. \nAll the sons of Goari, or all of me, can't live long. I don't know if it's because of incomplete reincarnation or too high intelligence, but anyway, they probably won't live past 30. And the reincarnation technique must be prepared many years in advance. So there is very little time to live a normal life. Compared to the past, it is a pity that we can live more easily and happily in Gensokyo now. The reincarnation technique is actually to beg for permission from Lord Yama before we are alive, and to work under Lord Yama in hell for more than a hundred years after we get the body for reincarnation and before reincarnation. In the meantime, even if it has become easier to travel to the underworld in Gensokyo now, I have no idea what Gensokyo has become. \n§YYes, the introductions you see under all the Gensokyo government advisors are written by Hieda Aqiu. §!"

When she was a human, her ability was to completely erase the existing history; when she transformed into Shirazawa, she could create history. The history of Gensokyo was created by her (×2The "Origin of Gensokyo" passed down from generation to generation by the Hieda family has places that her ability cannot reach. Therefore, "Origin of Gensokyo" is not the history she created, but the history of the Hieda family.).\ What exactly is history? The occurrence of a simple event cannot be called history. Only when it passes through someone's hands and is recorded and passed down as "history" can it be called history. Facts that did not actually happen and were fabricated out of thin air can become history, and conversely, objective events can be erased from history. Facts seen from one perspective are history. For the king of a country, Bai Ze's ability is the best tool for creating brilliant history. She usually lives in a human village and runs a temple house where she compiles history every day (×3 She has a very close relationship with the Hieda family.

Her personality is similar to that of ordinary humans, but you can also see a little difference. Maybe it's because she was originally a human from the outside world.

She can read the minds of souls that can't speak. Because of this, even the vengeful spirits avoid her. In order to effectively use the fact that the vengeful spirits are afraid of her, she is now in charge of managing the vengeful spirits that still remain in the ruins of the burning hell.

  advisor_yukari_desc:0 "When it comes to the most yokai-like yokai, we have to mention the name of Yakumo Yukari. This yokai is a yokai that no one wants to be an enemy of because of her dangerous root-related abilities, her elusive and unkind personality, and her completely different behavioral principles from humans. She looks no different from a human. She likes fancy clothes and holds a large parasol. She is mainly active at night and sleeps during the day. She is a typical yokai (×1Recently, as the number of humans active at night increases, the number of yokai active during the day has also increased.) \nAlso, although it is said that she hibernates in the winter, it is only said by herself and it is impossible to confirm where she actually lives, so the degree of truth is uncertain. In ancient times, a similar yokai appeared in the Yokai Record written by Aichi Gensokyo Enki (×2The first generation of Gensokyo Enki has a history of more than 1,200 years.). It is said that she appeared in attire and behavior that matched that era."

Based on this relationship, for the humans in Gensokyo, Lord Yanma is an absolute partner. In addition, there are also cases where long-lived humans carry too heavy sins.
